# Contract authority

`ores-platform/v1/schema.json` is the canonical portfolio wire contract.
`shared-auth-admin/v1/schema.json` is the canonical Shared Auth administration contract.
`ores-startup/v1/schema.json` is the canonical responsive-launch diagnostic event contract.
Bindings must preserve:

1. tenant and audience boundaries;
2. fail-closed assurance and authentication-method values;
3. bounded delegation depth;
4. no raw biometric material;
5. no token or secret values in errors, logs, or security events;
6. inactive introspection responses by default when state is unknown.

Responsive-launch diagnostics additionally require a per-launch correlation id, bounded
phase/dependency identifiers, explicit elapsed time and retry count, a fixed event/outcome
vocabulary, and `redaction_version: 1`. They may identify an exception type and retain a
small locally redacted stack, but never an error message, URL, token, credential, device
identifier, email address, or other user data. The local diagnostic buffer must be bounded.

Shared Auth directory grants additionally require:

1. the wrapped `DirectoryAdminGrantSet` discriminator and payload, never a loose object;
2. exact audience introspection at AAL2 or AAL3 and a required token/session `expiresAt`;
3. canonical UUIDs for grant, organization, and optional project identifiers;
4. exact non-wildcard directory scopes and an explicit `directory_admin` role;
5. no flat organization/project/scope claims outside `directoryGrants`;
6. no raw email field or cross-organization fallback.

Shared Auth global revocation additionally requires:

1. a service-authenticated exchange whose subject/access tokens are write-only, never fixture or
   log material, and bound to the exact `shared-auth-web-server` audience and singular global
   revocation scope;
2. immutable principal IDs; email is a transient operator search input and becomes a keyed
   digest before it enters the canonical contract;
3. explicit ambiguity handling and a short-lived server-bound principal-selection handoff;
4. provider tenant plus internal opaque identity handles, never raw provider credentials;
5. preview-before-execute blast-radius reporting with nullable unknown counts, explicit inventory
   status, exact unknown-field names, and explicit revocation scopes;
6. fresh phishing-resistant AAL2-or-higher WebAuthn step-up represented to the committing client
   only by a short-lived, one-use server-issued commit-authorization handle;
7. an auth-epoch/not-before fence committed before provider fan-out;
8. idempotent durable jobs with honest partial state and per-target bounded retry metadata,
   present only for scheduled retries and absent from terminal target results;
9. redacted audit correlation with no raw tokens, email addresses, session IDs, provider
   response bodies, or biometric material.

Changes require a versioned schema path and compatibility notes. Do not mutate v1 semantics
in place after a stable release.

`shared-auth/v1/schema.json` is the canonical cross-organization identity domain contract.
It covers organizations, projects, safe user projections, memberships, roles and bindings,
safe session/factor projections, audit events, and revocation by normalized email. The
revocation request carries the address as a write-only value; implementations normalize it
in memory, derive a keyed lookup HMAC, and discard it. The result cannot echo the address or
identify an organization for which the actor lacks `sessions.revoke`.

The schema's `Factor` projection deliberately has no verifier, private-key, biometric image,
or biometric-template field. Platform face/fingerprint/thumbprint checks are local WebAuthn
user-verification verdicts. SSH/OpenPGP keys remain with the credential authority; Shared
Auth stores an external-reference digest or public fingerprint only.

The four primary bindings are explicitly catalogued in
`shared-auth/v1/bindings.json`. They are hand-maintained because the foundational packages
remain dependency-free; `scripts/check_contracts.py` fails CI if a binding or required domain
type disappears. JSON Schema remains authoritative when a language type and wire rule differ.
in place after a stable release. The still-draft Shared Auth revocation control-plane definitions
preserve all existing v1 read-projection semantics.
